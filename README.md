## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is an intelligent, **locally-hosted AI chatbot** built using the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. It answers user questions based on real restaurant reviews â€” all **without needing an internet connection** once set up.

It integrates the following key technologies:

- ðŸ§  **LangChain** for chaining and managing the flow of data between components  
- ðŸ¤– **Ollama** with **LLaMA 3.2**, a local LLM for generating human-like responses  
- ðŸ“¦ **Chroma** for storing and retrieving vectorized reviews  
- ðŸ§¬ **Ollama Embeddings** to semantically embed textual data  
- ðŸ“Š **Pandas** for data preprocessing

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Loads and embeds** a dataset of restaurant reviews from a CSV file.
2. Stores them in a **Chroma** vector database.
3. On user input, the bot retrieves the **top 5 most relevant reviews**.
4. Combines the question + reviews and sends them to **LLaMA 3.2** for response generation.
